# Over View :

In our Project we made a database system for a hospital consists of  
  - Out door clinicals (Heart Clinic,physiological and neurological clinic,chest diseases clinic)
  - Ear and nose 
 - Dermatology clinic
 - Dentistry

# Technique used :
In our project we used (Python Flask) as a Back-end ,(Html,CSS) as front-end and MySql (for our database for hospital).

We made  Web page the user can choose the department he wants and click on the link the he will be directed to the page where he can download old reports to view it ,and if he is a doctor or an engineer and wants to add some edits to the reports he will enters his username and password to acces the data and add his Edits and comments and edited reports ,then this data will be saved to the database we created on MySql , and we can retrieve these data and reports again.

# Reports 
We made 4 Reports in our Project (PPM,daily,monthly,annual inspections)

 - Dental Department (Daily,monthly,annual inspections)
 - Ear ,Nose and throat Department (PPM)
 - Outdoor Clinical (PPM)
